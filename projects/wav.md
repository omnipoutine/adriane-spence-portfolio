I am a Caribbean Industrial Design graduate currently living in Toronto. My passion for design stems from a constant curiosity about how products and processes work. 

I believe that diversity and collaboration in design is the most efficient way to achieve the best results possible. I enjoy being presented with new challenges and experiences which I tend to approach with a positive yet critical mindset and an eye on the bigger picture. 

Outside of work, I spend my time in the sun, trying new foods, baking, and exploring new parts of the world.
